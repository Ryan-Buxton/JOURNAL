    <h1 class="box-bg">Ryan Buxton's Journal</h1>
         <p class="intro">This is my journal showcasing all of the work that I have done throughout this semester. This semester has taught me a lot of new tools that I previously thought to be unattainable. And while at times I still struggled trying to learn the very foreign language of HTML and CSS, I was able to pick up bits and pieces along the way. Some things came a bit more natually to me, and others could not find themselves sticking in my head. In the end I was still able to end up with a website and this journal, both of which I would have never of thought possible at the beginning of this semester. </p> 

    <h2>Learning Code</h2>
         <p>I am not the most technologically apt person out there, so having to learn HTML and how to code was a challenge for me. There was a lot of struggle on my end but I was glad to have been in a class and been surrounded by others who could help me out and eventually lead me into being able to code my own website at the end of this semester. There were so many facets to coding and this course, it felt like learning a whole new language. Technically two, counting css. I had a lot of technical dificulties with css as I tried making sure it was coded right and connecting to my HTML document. But regardless, I feel like I was able to grasp some of the basics when it comes to coding a website.  </p>

    <h2> My Timeline</h2>
         <p> The first major project I had to do was a timeline for Black History Month. I found a lot of challenge with this, and I tried many different ways to make the timeline itself. I had so many ideas that I wanted for the website but I kept running into walls and found my knowledge of HTML was just to small to be able to accomplish everything I had planned. I got discouraged and felt fearful for what was to come with the rest of the semester and what I would be challenged with in my growing HTML and CSS knowledge. Eventually I was able to create a timeline for Jimi Hendrix.  </p>
         <p>Here is the timeline of Jimi Hendrix for our Black History Month project:</p>

    <h2> My Map</h2>
         <p>Just like the previous project, I was unsure and not confident in my skills to be able to make a website showcasing a map. All these features and how to embed everything left me more and more confused with every step. The technicalities of coding and what is in my head are very far from eachother. I have the vision but dont acquire the skills to make it happen. These left me very discouraged the entire semster and I was unsure of how I would manage in making all these websites with different kinds of features like a timeline or a map. Eventually I was able to stop the technical problems from happening so much and was able to produce a map showing all kinds of affordable bars around Paris.  </p>
         <p> Here is a Google Map showcasing bars around Paris for AUP students to enjoy.</p>

     <h2> My Pixel Art </h2>
         <p>I was a lot more confident in my art abilities than my coding abilities. I found a greater ease and success with this assignment. I had some troubles in the beginning but was able to get through them pretty fast. I got the hang of how to make my art in excel and it ended up being a very mindless activity as I filled in all the squares with the colors I wanted. I found that this project was the easiest for me to achieve and am the most proud of how quickly I was able to over come the challenges that I did end up facing with this project. </p>
         <p> Here is Pixel art created by using Google Sheets of Space Invaders:</p>

     <h2> Coded Bias</h2>
         <p> In the documentary Coded Bias, we learned how coding and artificial intelligence affects our everyday life. From the bias programmed into facial recognition, which due to the data sets they were fed could not as accurately recognize the faces of people of color as they could their white counterparts. These systems are also used as ways of monitoring populations. Not just in China which has become infamous for its use of these technologies in its social credit system, which monitors people's behaviors and uses it to create a credit system which could affect things like bank loans, but also its use in European nations. London has been using facial recognition on its citizens in an attempt to catch criminals, with systems that often misidentify people. Additionally how Paris is trying to implement similar technology leading up to the Olympic games. </p>

     <h2> My Data Charts </h2>
         <p> While working on the final project, I could feel myself getting stuck again like I was in the beginning of the semester. I was having a lot of challenges with my graphs and I could not get them to behave and look the way I wanted and needed them to. But, I was able to sort it all out and create graphs that displayed the data I wanted to showcase for my final project. </p>
         <p> Here is a chart I made for my final project:</p>
         <iframe title="Farmerâ€™s Suicides in India" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Zp1po" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Zp1po/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script> 
    <h2> My Website</h2> 
         <p> My website drew from my experiences on the India practicum AUP offers over the winter break </p>
         <p> Here is the link to my final project website:</p>
         <p>file:///C:/Users/ryanb/Downloads/DIGITOOLKITFINAL/FINAL.html</p>
